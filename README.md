# Customer Management System (CMS)


Welcome to our Customer Management System (CMS) project! We made this project for big companies that have multiple branches across the country. We have two databases in this project, one for managing all branches and the other for managing all customers. Those two databases are branch.txt and customer.txt . In our program, we have two main parts: administration and branch management. The administrator can control all branch details, and the branch manager can control all customer details.In the customer section we add points to customer id accoding to their buying and delete point if they want to use those point for vouchers. This is a very basic customer management system with few functionalities.
